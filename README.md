# Followers

A simple tool to do some simple and basic analyses on followers for twitter users
Written in python3 (used version 3.10.6), language is Dutch (I can translate in English upon request.)

All credits for analyse.py script go to @r0zetta, I originally found this on:
https://blog.f-secure.com/how-to-get-twitter-follower-data-using-python-and-tweepy/

Install dependencies by:
´pip install -r requirements´

You will need twitter api auth. See: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/accessing-the-twitter-api-with-tweepy-8421329afc5c

Create a file in the same dir where these python files reside,  name it .login and paste your credentials in below order
* api key
* api secret
* acces token
* acces secret

python followers.py
(or alternatively, on many ubuntu distros, use python3 command instead of python)
